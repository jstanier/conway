Yet Another Conway's Game of Life. Written in [Processing 2.2.1](https://www.processing.org/). This version currently creates a random starting configuration, then runs for 50 iterations, after which it resets.

The easiest way to run it is to [download Processing](https://www.processing.org/download/) and run the sketch from within the UI.
